#+title: Lesim-Mode: Edit Learning Simulator Scripts in Emacs

#+options: toc:nil ':t

Lesim-Mode is an Emacs major mode to write and run [[https://learningsimulator.org][Learning Simulator]]
scripts. To learn more about the Learning Simulator, see this [[https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02891][short
article]] and the [[https://learningsimulator.readthedocs.io][online documentation]].

Lesim-Mode does not understand the full Learning Simulator
syntax. That is a job for Superman, that is, Learning Simulator chief
software architect [[https://github.com/markusrobertjonsson][Markus Jonsson]].

* Installing

Install from here for now, hopefully from MELPA later.

* Using

- Syntax coloring is enabled automatically. It also highlights some
  errors, line unassigned parameters.
- ~C-c C-c~ runs the script in the Learning Simulator (see
  [[Configuration]]), highlighting any errors.
- ~C-c C-v~ in a phase block aligns the block and highlights
  misspelled stimuli, behaviors, and phase line names.
- ~C-c C-v~ in a parameter block aligns the block.  
- ~TAB~ and ~Shift-TAB~ in a phase block move between
  fields. Elsewhere, they move by word.
- ~C-c C-t~ inserts a template script (see [[Configuration]]).

* Configuration

Using ~M-x customize-group lesim~ you can configure:
- The command used to run the Learning Simulator (default:
  ~lesim.py~).
- The key binding to run scripts.
- The key binding to align and validate code.
- The key binding to insert a template script.
- Whether to insert a template script automatically upon opening an
  empty ~.les~ file (default: ~nil~).

* Bugs and planned features
