Lesim-mode is an Emacs major mode to write and run [[https://learningsimulator.org][Learning Simulator]]
scripts. To learn more about the Learning Simulator, see this [[https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02891][short
article]] and the [[https://learningsimulator.readthedocs.io][online documentation]].

Lesim-mode helps to ensure that a script is correct by highlighting
common syntax errors and typos, like misspelled keywords and stimulus
elements. However, it does not understand the full Learning Simulator
syntax. That is a job for Superman, that is, Learning Simulator chief
software architect [[https://github.com/markusrobertjonsson][Markus Jonsson]].

You can run Learning Simulator scripts directly from lesim-mode
buffers. Errors are reported in the minibuffer and highlighted in the
script buffer.

For integration with org-mode, see [[https://githb.com/drghirlanda/ob-lesim][ob-lesim mode]].

* Installing

Install from here for now, hopefully from MELPA later. It's enough to
add the lesim-mode directory to your Emacs [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LoadPath][load path]] and ~(require
'lesim-mode)~ in your ~.emacs.d/init.el~.

* Using

- Syntax highlighting is enabled automatically.
- Parameter assignments and other constructs are validated
  automatically and highlighted to reflect if they are correct or not.
- ~C-c C-c~ runs the script in the Learning Simulator, highlighting
  any errors.
- ~TAB~ and ~Shift-TAB~ in move between fields in phase blocks, and by
  word elsewhere. They also align phase blocks as ~|~ signs and
  parameter blocks at ~=~ signs.
- ~C-c C-t~ inserts a template script (see [[Configuration]]).

* Configuration

Using ~M-x customize-group lesim~ you can configure:
- The command used to run the Learning Simulator (default:
  ~lesim.py~).
- The key binding to run scripts.
- The key binding to align code.
- The key binding to insert a template script.
- Whether to insert a template script automatically upon opening an
  empty ~.les~ file (default: ~nil~).

* Bugs and planned features
