* Introduction

Lesim-Mode is an Emacs major mode to write and run Learning Simulator
scripts. Its features are:
- Syntax highlighting.
- Align parameter blocks at the ~=~ sign.[fn:colon]
- Align phase lines within a phase block at ~|~ signs.
- Highlight misspelled stimuli, behaviors, and line names in phase
  blocks.
- Handy movement by field in phase blocks.    
- Insert script template.
- Run scripts through the Learning Simulator.  
  
Lesim-Mode does not understand the full Learning Simulator
syntax. That is a job for Superman, that is, Learning Simulator chief
software architect [[https://github.com/markusrobertjonsson][Markus Jonsson]]. 

[fn:colon] The earlier Learning Simulator syntax using ~:~ for
assignments is not supported by Lesim-Mode.

* Installation

Install from here for now, hopefully from MELPA later.

* Quick start

- Syntax coloring is enabled automatically. It also highlights some
  errors, line unassigned parameters.
- Press ~TAB~ anywhere in the buffer. This has different actions depending on context:
  - In a parameter block, it aligns the block.
  - In a phase block, it aligns the block, highlights misspelled
    stimulus elements, behaviors, and phase line names, and moves to
    the next field.
  - Everywhere else, it has currently no effect.
- Press ~C-c r~ to run the script in the Learning Simulator (see
  [[Configuration]]).
- Press ~C-c t~ to insert a template to get started on a script (see
  [[Configuration]]).

* Learning Simulator

You can learn about the Learning Simulator from these sources:
- [[https://learningsimulator.org][The Learning Simulator Website]]
- [[https://learningsimulator.readthedocs.io][Learning Simulator documentation on Read The Docs]]
- [[https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02891][Short article in the Journal of Open Source Software]]  

* Configuration

Using ~M-x customize-group lesim~ you can configure:
- The command used to run the Learning Simulator (default:
  ~lesim.py~).
- The key binding to run scripts (default: ~C-c r~).
- The key binding to insert a template script (default: ~C-c p~).
- Whether to insert a template script automatically upon opening an
  empty ~.les~ file (default: ~nil~).
- Other minor items explained in the customization buffer.    

* Planned features

- Look up parameter definitions in the online docs.
- Use online docs to set default parameter values.
- Parse assignments to highlight syntax and content errors.
- Highlight and validate plotting commands.  
- Add Lesim menu.

  script text.
