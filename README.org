Lesim-mode is an Emacs major mode to write and run [[https://learningsimulator.org][Learning Simulator]]
scripts. To learn more about the Learning Simulator, see this [[https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02891][short
article]] and the [[https://learningsimulator.readthedocs.io][online documentation]].

Lesim-mode helps to ensure that a script is correct by highlighting
common errors, like misspelled keywords and stimulus
elements.[fn:markus] 

You can run Learning Simulator scripts directly from lesim-mode
buffers. Errors are reported in the minibuffer and highlighted in the
script buffer.

For integration with org-mode, see [[https://githb.com/drghirlanda/ob-lesim][ob-lesim mode]].

[fn:markus] However, lesim-mode does not understand the full Learning
Simulator syntax. That is a job for Superman, that is, Learning
Simulator chief software architect [[https://github.com/markusrobertjonsson][Markus Jonsson]].

* Installing

Install from MELPA, then add ~(require 'lesim-mode)~ to your Emacs
init file (e.g., ~.emacs.d/init.el~).

* Using

Syntax highlighting is enabled automatically.

~C-c C-c~ runs the script in the Learning Simulator, highlighting any
error.

Even without running a script, some common errors are highlighted (not
100% accurate).

Hovering on an error with the mouse pops up a description. ~C-c C-n~
moves to the next error, displaying a description in the minibuffer.

~TAB~ and ~Shift-TAB~ in move between fields in phase blocks, and by
word elsewhere. They also align phase blocks at ~|~ signs and
parameter blocks at ~=~ signs.

~C-c C-t~ inserts a template script (see [[Configuration]]).

~C-c C-l~ re-highlights the whole script, in case something looks
funny.

* Configuration

Using ~M-x customize-group lesim~ you can configure:
- The command used to run the Learning Simulator (default: ~lesim.py~).
- The key bindings mentioned in the previous section.
- Whether to insert a template script when opening an empty ~.les~
  file (default: ~nil~).

* Bugs and planned features
