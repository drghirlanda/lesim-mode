Lesim-mode is an Emacs major mode to write and run [[https://learningsimulator.org][Learning Simulator]]
scripts. To learn more about the Learning Simulator, see this [[https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02891][short
article]] and the [[https://learningsimulator.readthedocs.io][online documentation]].

Lesim-mode helps to ensure that a script is correct by highlighting
common syntax errors and typos, like misspelled keywords and stimulus
elements.[fn:markus]

You can run Learning Simulator scripts directly from lesim-mode
buffers. Errors are reported in the minibuffer and highlighted in the
script buffer.

For integration with org-mode, see [[https://githb.com/drghirlanda/ob-lesim][ob-lesim mode]].

[fn:markus] However, lesim-mode does not understand the full Learning
Simulator syntax. That is a job for Superman, that is, Learning
Simulator chief software architect [[https://github.com/markusrobertjonsson][Markus Jonsson]].

* Installing

Install from here for now, hopefully from MELPA later.

Open the lesim-mode directory in Emacs and do ~M-x
package-install-from-buffer~.

Add ~(require 'lesim-mode)~ to your Emacs init file (most often,
~.emacs.d/init.el~).

* Using

Syntax highlighting is enabled automatically.

Parameter assignments and other constructs are highlighted if
incorrect. (Not 100% comprehensive yet.)

~C-c C-c~ runs the script in the Learning Simulator, highlighting
errors in the buffer.

~TAB~ and ~Shift-TAB~ in move between fields in phase blocks, and by
word elsewhere. They also align phase blocks at ~|~ signs and
parameter blocks at ~=~ signs.

~C-c C-t~ inserts a template script (see [[Configuration]]).

~C-c C-h~ re-highlights the whole script, case something looks funny.
  
* Configuration

Using ~M-x customize-group lesim~ you can configure:
- The command used to run the Learning Simulator (default: ~lesim.py~).
- The key binding to run scripts.
- The key binding to insert a template script.
- The key binding to re-highlight the buffer.
- Whether to insert a template script when opening an empty ~.les~
  file (default: ~nil~).

* Bugs and planned features
